# Classes in OOP
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.

A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects, which share the same attributes and methods defined within the class. Attributes represent the data or state of an object, and methods represent the actions that can be performed on the object.

For example, a class called "Car" may have attributes such as color, model, and year, and methods such as start, stop, and accelerate.

# Objects in OOP
In OOP, **objects** are **instances** of **classes**. When an object is created from a class, it has access to all the attributes and methods defined in the class. The process of creating an object from a class is called **instantiation**.

Classes provide abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are the fundamental concepts of OOP. 
Abstraction is the ability to hide complex implementations and only show the necessary details to the user. 
Encapsulation is the process of hiding data and methods within a class to prevent unauthorized access. 
Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent or base class. 
Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used.
